<h1 id="reach">C programming Introduction</h1>

<p>
C is an imperative procedural language supporting structured programming, 
lexical variable scope, and recursion, 
with a static type system.
 It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine 
all with minimal runtime support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming.
 A standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems 
with few changes to its source code
